# Imagej_Mathematica-kinetics
distance between marked points are measured in ImageJ.
  - processing given image to b&w and extracting cordinates of the required objects.

In mathematica all the data is processed and plotted.
  - Also the expected model is solved numerically plotted along with data.

Further fit optimization and improvizations are done in Python using Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.
